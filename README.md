## Dataset
TMDb movie data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.


## Summary of Findings
It can be seen that the total number of movies has increased significantly over the years. And in terms of genre, it was possible to observe an increasing trend in animation and documentary, and a decreasing trend in history, music, war, and western. The variables that had a positive correlation with revenue were popularity and budget.


I analyzed the popularity of movies by genre by the number of movies, but if I analyzed them by popularity or revenue, I could get a different aspect. In the correlation analysis with revenue, there were not many types of properties that could be tried, and it can be seen that it is not independent of revenue and popularity.
